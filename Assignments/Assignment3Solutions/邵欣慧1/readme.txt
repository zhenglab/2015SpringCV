This code is used for segmentation include grab cut and meanshift.The grab cut's enironment is matlab (at least matlab 2007) and codeblock with opencv.

grab cut:
This code fall into many steps, such as input image with batch, use image signature, draw the rectangle, implement grab cut, evaluate segmentation result.

Patten attention:
    1) draw the rectangle and implement grab cut are in C;
   

meanshift:
This code fall into many steps, such as input image with batch,segment via mean shift,evaluate segmentation result with groundtruth.
 Patten attention:
    1) when inputing image with batch,you should input all images into the one number floder.
    2) pay attention the name.
