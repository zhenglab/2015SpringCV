This project implement segmentation through grab cut and meanshift. 
Matlab(Matlab 7.0 and all the higher editions) and Visual Stadio(2008 andall the higher editions) are needed for this project.

PART£É£ºGrab_cut£º
Firstly,run "main1.m"in "Grab_cut1"file. This m file implement batch procssing for the database "PASCAL". Then,run the"Grab_cut2.cpp" in the "Grab_cut2"file.Thirdly, run the "evaluation.m" in "Grab_cut2" file. After these three steps are done, the PRF bar graph is gotten.

PART II:MeanShift:This fold contains a program for mean shift and evaluation.
The package contains: MeanShift.m; meanShiftPixCluster.m and processSuperpixelImage.m. 

Installation:
1.Open meanShift.m ,change path and run it.
2.Run meanShiftPixCluster.m. 3. Run meanShiftPixCluster.m.
